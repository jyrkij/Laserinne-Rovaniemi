/**
 * SkierContestant is an abstract class to support skier contestants.
 * 
 * Gives basic support to checking if contestant has crossed finish line,
 * timing the race and determining the winner.
 * 
 * Has method stubs for score tracking and weighting.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 *  First, implement all abstract methods.
 *  
 *  Before using anything, call this.startLine(int) and this.finishLine(int)
 *  to set start and finish lines.
 *  
 *  Call constantly this.update() to get updated info on skier status. This
 *  method also starts the skier automatically.
 *  
 *  Constantly call this.finished() to figure out if the skier has finished.
 *  When both have finished, call this.winner() to get string telling the
 *  winner and its time.
